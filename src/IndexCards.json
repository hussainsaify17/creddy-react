            "SBI tied up with the UAE-based Etihad Airways airline and launched two travel credit cards in 2019: Etihad Guest SBI Credit Card and Etihad Guest SBI Premier Card. Needless to say, the Premier version offers more benefits and also carries a higher annual fee. Back then, the travel industry was one of the booming industries in the country. SBI probably launched this card considering that the travel-related spends accounted for 33% of the overall card spends in the SBI credit card portfolio at the time of launch of the card (certainly not the case now, due to the COVID pandemic). Also, Dubai is one of the favorite destinations among Indian travelers as there is a fairly large diaspora of NRIs in Dubai and many Indian HNIs (high net-worth individuals) frequently travel to Dubai on business trips. Etihad Guest SBI Premier card earns you Etihad Airways AirMiles (called Etihad Guest Miles) for every Rs. 100 spent using the card (number of AirMiles earned varies depending upon the category of spends). You also get many travel-related welcome benefits and milestone advantages with the premier card. Keep reading to know more about the card:"
