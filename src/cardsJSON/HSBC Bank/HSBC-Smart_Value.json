    "The HSBC Smart Value Credit Card is among the most popular lifetime free credit cards in the Indian market. It comes with a zero annual & joining fee and provides its customers with several exciting welcome benefits, including complimentary airport lounge access, an Amazon gift voucher worth Rs. 500, up to Rs. 100 cashback on Google Pay, and up to Rs. 1,000 cashback on retail transactions within the first 60 days. Talking about its reward program, it earns you up to 3 Reward Points on every spend of Rs. 100. These reward points can be redeemed against an array of options available at the HSBC Rewards catalogue. However, you don't get many premium benefits with this card, but it can still be considered a great option for people who are new to the world of credit cards.",
