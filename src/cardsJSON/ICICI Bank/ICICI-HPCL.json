    "ICICI bank has launched this new exclusive co-branded credit card on 20th July, 2021 in collaboration with Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL). This is an addition to the bank's catalog of HPCL credit cards. The unique feature of the Super Saver credit card is that, unlike most other co-branded cards that earn you cashback/rewards only on one particular category of spends, the ICICI Bank HPCL Super Saver Card earns you cash back and/or reward points benefit (as Reward points) on all categories of spends.",
    "It comes with a joining or annual fee of Rs. 500 and earns you bonus reward points as well as cashback as a welcome benefit. With this co-branded card, you can always save up to 5% on your spends. Other than this, you get various other benefits, including exclusive airport lounge access, exciting discount deals on dining & movies, spend-based reversal of the renewal fee, and many more.
