    "ICICI bank offers the InterMiles ICICI Bank Sapphiro Credit Card in collaboration with the InterMiles frequent flyer program. It comes in two variants- the Visa variant and the American express variant. The two variants slightly differ in terms of the benefits they offer. Earlier, the card used to offer special benefits on Jet Airways bookings, but since the airline ceased its operation in 2018, you get special privileges on Etihad airlines flight bookings, which owns over 50% share in Jet Airways. As is obvious from the name, it is a travel credit card and earns you reward points as InterMiles on all spends made via the card. Read on to know more about this offering by the ICICI bank."
