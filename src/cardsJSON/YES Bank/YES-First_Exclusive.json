    "The First Exclusive credit card is a high-end offering by Yes bank. It can be considered a direct competitor to HDFC's most premium Infinia credit card. The card comes with complimentary access to both international as well as Domestic airport lounges. Apart from that, what makes this card such a lucrative offering in the premium segment is one of the lowest foreign currency markups by industry standards (1.75%). But that's not it, since it is a very premium card, you also get many other benefits like 24Ã—7 concierge service, complimentary rounds of golf, Priority Pass membership, and movie ticket bookings at a discounted rate. Read the article for further information about this card."
